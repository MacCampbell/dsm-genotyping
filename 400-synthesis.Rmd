##Summary of DSM variants

We have a few data sources:    

__1__ Genotype calls from RADseq (102-dsm-genos.html)     
__2__ Benjamin et al. hybridization assay SNPS (200-hybrids.html)     
__3__ Lew et al. parentage SNPs (300-parentage.html)     
__4__ Sex marker, status ????      


More of a 1b, I'm also throwing in a few Mac Campbell selects of life-history association.
