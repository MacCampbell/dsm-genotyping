# dsm-genotyping
Genotyping with available Delta Smelt data.    

What do we have?      

Should have ~770 samples.      

Organization:

__1__ `/meta/` sample information       
I (Mac Campbell) had a file, meta.csv, from 07212020 that has information about sequenced DSM. I changed it so that the columns were consistent through the file.

__2__ `/outputs/` outputs from analyses/scripts    
__3__ `Analysis Scripts xxx-yyy-zzz.Rmd`
